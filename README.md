# Notes

BLaundry is an online game that anyone can run in their browser. The game is controlled with arrows keys (left, right, up) or the space bar (for jumping).

BLaundry was built using Express and Phaser.js. Each player's highest score is stored in their browser via local HTML storage. There are 5 game states (Boot, Preload, Menu, Game, and End).
