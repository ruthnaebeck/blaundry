# BLaundry

This is a silly game about a bear who likes clean laundry.  Help the bear gather as many clothes as possible before time runs out.

Play the game at https://blaundry.herokuapp.com/.  The bear can be controlled using the left and right arrow keys for movement and the up arrow key or spacebar for jumping.
